Overview
--------

A [Play application](http://www.playframework.com/) that provides an interface for students to buy and sell textbooks.

Students can go to the site and create a profile to identify themselves. Then they can create BuyOffers and SellOffers
for a given book. After that, they can find their "matches". The match report will list all BuyOffers for the specified
student that have SellOffers for the same book.

Installation
--------

Download the zip file, unzip, cd into the directory, invoke the Play console, and execute
the run command to see the application at http://localhost:9000

Usage
--------

The database is globally initialized with 18 books, 3 students, 5 buy offers and 5 sell offers. You can see the lists
by clicking on the respective links via the nav bar.

There are also links to create a new student profile, to add a new textbook to the database, or to find buy/sell matches.

At this time any user using this application is allowed to read, create, update, or delete any of the records on the site.
